### Project #3: Navigation Bars

#### For this project we are going to build out a navigation bar like the ones you would common see at the top of most websites.

The navigation bar should:
1. Have 5 top menu items: Home, About, Locations, FAQ and Contact.
2. Hovering over ‘About’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to ‘Bio’ and ‘Portfolio’.
3. Hovering over Locations should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to Austin, ‘Houston’, ‘Dallas’, and ‘San Antonio’.
4. Hovering over ‘FAQ’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to Why do business with us and Our Partners’.
5. Hovering over ‘Contact’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to ‘Phone’ and ‘Email us’.
6. The top menu bars should have a dark blue color (#01579B).
7. When you hover over a top menu item, it should change to a light blue color (#9AD1E3).
8. When you hover over a submenu item, it should change to a light green color (#ACE39A).
9. The body of the webpage should have a light gray color (#ECEFF1).
10. The menu blocks should have a height of 70px and a width of 300px.
11. You should Google Fonts and have the font ‘Oswald’.

Hints:

* Your HTML will have a list within a list.
* You’ll want to remove any default styling from the lists.
* You will need to use display: block.
* You will need to use the CSS hover selector.
* You will need to use floats.

Final note: With CSS selectors, there are multiple ways of selecting things. You can achieve the same effects by doing things differently. But remember that you don’t necessarily need to create multiple classes and ID’s for everything that you want to select. For example, try selecting specific list items with “li ul li”, and links within those list items with “li ul li a”.
